I took all TODOs from the source files and shoved them into here:
- [ ] don't render offscreen text
- [ ] add list of recent files
- [x] add lua plugin support
- [ ] allow comments in ini files
- [ ] width/height props in config
- [ ] switch to sdl's method of open/save file dialogs instead of using nfd
